STRATEGY FOR THE EXAMPLE GIVEN

// IMPROVE: this can be better. explain what means local minimum (of what?). and
// why this local minimum would favor our main goal of defeating the maximum
// number of castles.
  Let's try being greedy and assume the local minimum to be the
best option in order to maximize the number of defeated castles.

We look at the road map so far and we sort the possible targets by their army
size. we visualize this in the form <castle id>: <army size>. The *() marks the
castle we're in at the moment.

               *(0:144)     { 5: 11, 6: 25, 8: 35, ..., 7: 34 }

 As we're being greedy we pick the castle 5 to attack.

 One big army is stronger than two halves of it. And as so we leave 50 of our
men home and move the rest as a unit. For doing so our army size is 94. As we
defeat the 5's army our own is reduced by 22, so we're now 72. Cheerful by the
recent win we march to next castle, which is castle 6. As we leave 50 man in
castle 5 we look at the map we see the following:
                             
               0: 50 { 5: 50,   *(72) X 6: 25   , 8: 35, ..., 7: 34 }

  Leaving 50 of our men behind means the rest of our power is 22 men. And that
makes the biggest army we can defeat a 11 man army. In the middle of the way
towards castle 6 we realize this and we abort the mission.

  The maximum number of castle we can take in the region, leaving 50 men as
guards in each castle we leave behind, is 1. That means that no matter which
castle of those we can defeat we pick, after the battle we're reduced to the
point we can no longer battle any other.
